# hello-world

Hi everybody,

My name is Adam and I am the founder at White Space Analytics.  At White Space we have the mission of capturing the differences in every piece of information.  We do this by mashing together a whole load of technologies, a passion for reading and a tried and tested method for running successful information projects!!

I look forward to collaborating.
